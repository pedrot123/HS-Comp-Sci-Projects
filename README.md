<h1>High School Computer Science Projects</h1>

This is the archive of some of the past projects I completed in High School. During my Sophomore year, I took Intro to Computer Science, and in my junior year, I took AP Computer Science A. 

Unfortunately, my school shut down my AWS account, so most of my APCS/Java code is gone. I could only upload the few examples I had saved on my computer.
